Shared Library Names
=======================

Linux shared library can have three names. Which are:

	Linker name (eg: libexample.so)
	Soname (eg : libexample.so.1.2)
	Real Name (eg : libexample.so.1.2.3)

Linker Name
==============

Linker Name is the name that is requested by the linker when another code is linked with your library (with â€“lexample linker option). 

Linker name typically starts with
	the prefix lib
	name of the library
	the phrase .so

soname
=============

Every shared library has a special name called the ``soname''.

The soname has 
	the prefix ``lib'', 
	the name of the library, 
	the phrase ``.so'', 
	followed by a period 
	and a version number that is incremented whenever the interface changes 

Eg. libarith.so.1

Real Name
=============

Real Name is the actual name of the shared library file. 

Real Name = soname + minor version number

Eg. libarith.so.1.0

It can also be libarith.so.1.0.1.3

During shared library installation
=====================================

soname is a symbolic link to the real name

linker name is a symbolic link to the soname

In this way both soname and linker names ultimately point to the real name of the library (i.e. actual library file).

Command to read the soname
============================
$ readelf -d libarith.so
