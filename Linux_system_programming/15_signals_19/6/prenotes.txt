What happens when forking?
=============================

The child process inherits a copy of the parent's signal dispositions. In other words, if you have installed a SIGINT handler before forking, then the child process will also call the handler if a SIGINT is delivered to the child.

/* at fork, similar to parent's open file copying, signal handlers are also copied */
