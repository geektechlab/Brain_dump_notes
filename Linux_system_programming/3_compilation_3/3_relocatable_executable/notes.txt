Extracting Information from .o and executable binary files
==============================================================

gcc produces executable files in the ELF file format. 

you can use readelf and objdump to read parts of an elf file

$ readelf -h hello.o

	Type: Relocatable file

$ readelf -h exec 

	Type: Executable

-h will print ELF Header

$ readelf --symbols hello.o

will show us symbols in the object file

i is said LOCAL
	That is because we declared it static and as such it has been flagged as being local to this object file.

global is GLOBAL
	meaning that it is visible outside this file

Similarly the main() function is externally visible

function is UND (undefined)
	This means that it has been left for the linker to find the address of the function
