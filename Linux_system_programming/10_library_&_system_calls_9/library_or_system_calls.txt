Library functions vs. System Calls
========================================

Standard functions can be divided in two main categories :-
	1. Library function calls.
	2. System function calls.

The functions which are a part of standard C library are known as Library functions.
E.g. strcmp(), strlen()

The functions which change the execution mode of the program from user mode to kernel mode are known as system calls
E.g. socket(), open(), read() , write()

A library function is linked to the user program and executes in user space but a system call is not linked to a user program and executes in kernel space.
