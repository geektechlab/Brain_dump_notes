File I/O
=======================

In Linux everything is a file, even directory is a file 

Most file I/O on a UNIX system can be performed with six system calls: 
	open, 
	read, 
	write, 
	lseek, 
	close,
	dup, dup2

while using these function calls, we can figure out which header file to include by man command.
