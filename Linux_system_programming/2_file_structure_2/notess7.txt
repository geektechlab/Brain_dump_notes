proc
=======================
	It contains special files that represent system and process information.
	quite a lot of system utilities are simply calls to files in this directory
	'lsmod' is the same as 'cat /proc/modules
	'lspci' is a synonym for 'cat /proc/pci'
	/proc/meminfo contains a bunch of information about your system's memory
	/proc/uptime uptime information (in seconds).
	/proc/partitions detailed info about partitions available to the system.
	/proc/cmdline kernel command line information.
====================================================

The /proc filesystem maps mostly to the process table.
People found this very useful, and started adding other things to it as well - cpuinfo, memory statistics, device information 
but it also raised the issue that /proc was SUPPOSED to be for the process table
So they added another instance, and named it sys aimed to hold system information

=============================
sys
========================

	sysfs is used by programs such as udev to access device and device driver information. 
	To get the a network card's MAC address
	cat /sys/class/net/eth0/address
